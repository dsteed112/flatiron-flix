# FlationFlix
 
FlationFlix is a web application that allows users to make custom "watch list" and "watched" lists of movies using The Movie Database (TMDb) API with localStorage.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage
To search the database for movies click the "+ Add" button. Here the user will see the title, summary, TMDb rating, and year of release for specified movie.

The user can add the movie to their "Watch List" or "Watched" list using the corresponding buttons.

These lists can be accessed from the top nav bar and edited with the icons that appear when the user hovers over the movie poster.

Both lists are stored in local storage.
